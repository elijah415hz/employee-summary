## Description
Employee Summary Generator is a simple CLI that generates a static webpage that displays information for an entire team of employees based on user input. It uses inquirer for its interactive functionality. Employee Summary Generator dynamically responds to the user's input and serves the user different questions based on their answers. It is primarily an exploration in object oriented programming and class inheritance. The fact that it is based in the command line limits its usefulness, so there is definitely room for further development here. A good next step for this program will be to connect it to an employee database and set up functionality for it to generate a pleasing display of employee information based on a query of that database.
